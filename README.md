<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was written to perform two very specific tasks using the smartsheet API.

* To poulate a dropdown list with options from a target column
* to update two co-dependent columns, such as the parts of an engine, and the engines a part can be found in.

Other features may be added later if requested, but for now it performs these two tasks

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If your aim is to update a sheet or column regularly, I would recomend setting up the main.py with your column titles and converting it to an executable. in order for this to work i would recomend setting up an environment with the smartsheet-python-sdk and adding the executable to its path.

### Prerequisites

in your smartsheet environment install the smartsheet-python-sdk package by typing:

` $ pip install smartsheet-python-sdk` in your command prompt

If you want to run the project as an executable, also install auto-py-to-exe, using the command:

`$ pip install auto-py-to-exe`

### setting up

#### Set main.py
in the main.py file

set the correct name values

```workspace = 'Workspace name'
dropdown_sheet = 'Dropdown Sheet Name'
dropdown_col = 'Dropdown column name'

origin_sheet = 'Origin Sheet Name'
origin_col = 'Origin Column Name'
col_type = 'MULTI_PICKLIST'

frst_sheet = 'First Sheet Name'
scnd_sheet = 'Second Sheet Name'
frst_key_col = 'First Search Column'
frst_val_col = 'First Co-dependent Column'
scnd_key_col = 'Second Search Column'
scnd_val_col = 'Second Co-dependent Column'
```

#### Installation

convert your .py file to an exe, for an example how to do this visit: https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After this, using the project is as simple as clicking on the executable!

The first time it will ask you to enter your API key.

From the smartsheet home screen, access your account, and click on Apps & Integrations...

**Be aware, you may need owner or admin rights for the sheets you wish to edit**

Paste this key into the terminal and press enter.

The program will ask you to renew your API key once every week.
