# smartsheet
Smartsheet API implementation to update co-dependent sheets

This project was written with two specific goals in mind.

1. To populate dropdown lists with items from a different file

2. to update multi picklist columns in two different files so that they match.

   These multi picklist columns are essentially dictionaries, Where the keys of one dictionary are the values of the other, and vice versa.
   These dictionaries should match, so this script was written to update them once per day.


If you have any suggestions, improvements or added functionality, feel free to contribute!
